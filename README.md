# Before

I'll take a component driven route and just build each component contained in the page, make it responsive and it should be ok.

component list :

- [ ] Header 
- [ ] Footer 
- [ ] Search Results 
- [ ] Search Form 
- [ ] Hero  
- [ ] Result Card 
- [ ] Pagination 

The idea is to first build a mobile version and make it stretch into a desktop version.

Some points : 

- the mobile version in Figma seems a bit wrong : Footer is replaced by external offers
- the fonts aren't consistent across the page : `Open Sans` for Header, `Manrope` for Search Form & Pagination & Footer, `DM Sans` for Search Results
